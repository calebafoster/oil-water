He tried, when he was young to revolutionize hunting methods for his clan, by charting the movements of the prey animals on maps. What he didn't realize was reaver claws also use this method of laying traps for the animals, of food or water and pounce on the prey. The new methods were good for a little bit but led to the death of one of the elders.
