# Snow Area
## Biotic Factors
### Herbivores
### Carnivores
### Omnivores
#### Human
- Needs to use external emulsifiers to consume most plants and animals. After an oil is emulsified it loses a significant amount of it's adaptability, becoming useful only as fuel.
### Decomposers
Maybe decomposers can be dichotomous. There is a subset of water decomposers, and a subset of oil decomposers, rarely both.
### Producers
Producers in this world would need to feed off of the inherent energy found in the oil drops, as there is no sun to photosynthesize. So trees don't need leaves and also don't need to be green. If I want plants that sort of resemble plants in the real world i will need to come up with a justification beyond that desire. It's possible that there is also an inherent energy source deep underground too, in the ground water of the water world.
#### Bowl Tree
- Has leaves that catch falling oil drops and keep them for slow emulsion.
## Abiotic Factors
## Habitat
Technically snow would be quite rare because there isn't water precipitation. The land is mostly covered in thick layers of ice because water wants to rise to the surface for some reason. The falling oil creates sporadic dimples in the ice that can be used for traction in locomotion.
