#### Starting Premise
- ~~Character that lives on an island with limited outside contact in a world post post apocalyptic.
- ~~Each Island in the archipelago with people uses magic in wildly different ways from the character and from each other
	- no longer going to do islands
- The character goes on a mission to categorize and learn each type of magic.
- Probably a witcher type anthology
- The world is broken the sky city drips oil daily, tainted with whatever calamity brought the previous empire to it's knees. It's been dripping for years now, causing plague and famine, droughts and disasters. 
- The world is two stacked on top of each other. two flat planes facing each other each with it's own gravity, except the oil is unaffected. Causing the great [[Emulsion]].
#### Unsorted Ideas
- "Witchy" village that uses a brew in center of town and modifies each cup when going to make a spell. When the spell is finished they return the brew to the center.
	- Effects are wildly difficult to predict but over the years consistency of "cultivation" as an effect has taken hold.
	- Maybe the problem is something has contaminated the brew.
- ~~MC probably a three with a 5 side character, and faces more and more things that defy chronicling.
- ~~Central theme of Xenophobia or something. The reason there isn't as much cultural diffusion.
- fire-based civilization uses tattoos like flint and steels
- Kingdom that uses Raven's Oil to transform into Bird-like Humans
- There is a fundamental force of Oil that was messed with somehow
	- Water's fundamental force is hidden away
#### Questions that Need Answering
- What was oil world like before the [[Emulsion]]
- Who is our [[Helion]]
- What is our central theme
	- Xenophobia?
	- Climate Change?
	- Letting go?
	- Corrupting Power?
