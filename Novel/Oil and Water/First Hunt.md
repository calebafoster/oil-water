[[Keller Nevson|Keller]] slipped on the ice as the oil falls began. It was just a drizzle, but it was enough to apply a thin coat to the ground of the slick substance. Helion put his hand on Keller's back to stabilize him, as Keller awkwardly readjusted his quiver, which had slid to his front while climbing the last hill.

"Is this the furthest north you've been?" Keller asked, with a slight huff to his voice. They had been walking for hours. Keller wiped sweat from his forehead as [[Helion]] threw down his pack and rummaged through it, pulling out a small bundle of firewood. They only had enough for one night, though if they were lucky, the oil falls would continue the fire for longer. "You sure we should use that now?"

"[[Reaver claws]] only ever come this far south," said Helion. "If we want to kill any before first light, we need to lure them to us." Helion rolled up his sleeve, which revealed the intricate tattoos on his forearm; tattoos that Keller should have already earned. With a quick motion Helion dragged a flint across it, sending a flash of sparks into the oil soaked wood. One strike was all it took for the fire to start.

He winced as blood started dripping down his arm. He held his arm over the fire letting it lick the wound. A few drops fell and evaporated on the coals. "That's really all it takes?" Keller asked. He had never hunt reaver claws before. He'd never been allowed to. Now he was apprenticed to a younger man. _A younger man who had earned his tattoos_, Keller thought.

Helion chuckled to himself. "You should try carving your skin out with a rock. Maybe you'd be more appreciative of the sacrifice." He dropped the piece of flint into his pocket. "Reavers smell to hunt. For some reason burning flesh attracts them. That amount of blood should be enough to lure them out. We have a bit of time till then" Helion's orange eyes caught Keller staring at his tattoos. He replaced his sleeves. "You'll earn them soon friend. It was mere good fortune I was able to earn them so early. The Elders will see your talents soon enough."

Keller appreciated the consolation, but Helion was wrong of course. It wasn't chance that earned him those tattoos. Helion made a name for himself as the best hunter of his generation from before Keller was even permitted to use a bow. And when a black beast with wings the size of a building threatened the Elder House of [[Yourlok|Yourlok]], Helion put an arrow in all but one of it's six eyes. Keller was there. He threw a spear or two before it was downed. None of them found purchase in it's scaled hide.

Helion sat back against a pile of snow. Keller followed suit. He tried to keep the cold from lulling him to sleep as the wind picked up but, eventually his battle against the weary of his journey was lost.
